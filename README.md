# Spatial_Partition_Example

This is a project that is based on this article: https://www.habrador.com/tutorials/programming-patterns/19-spatial-partition-pattern/

This project has changes from the original build such as:
 - a switch between no spatial partition patter and spatial partition pattern occuring for the bubbles and the change of material
 - Update text showing, in milliseconds, the time it takes for the program to run
 - Built the spatial partition to be in 3D instead of 2D
 - The object that triggers the material change is invisible
 - The objects shown are now "bubbles" that get shiny
